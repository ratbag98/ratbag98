- 👋 Hi, I’m @ratbag98
- 👀 I’m interested in Unity, Crypto, Elixir, Obsidian/PKM/Second Brain
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Python (missed them first time around)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, don't take it personally.
- 📫 How to reach me - you don't need to know right now.

I'm a fifty-something coder who rose up through the ranks in a UK university as an analyst, architect then manager. This didn't agree with me so I left to join a fledgling hedge fund, then a Canadian startup.

Then Covid came and I decided to take a break from all that work stuff. It seems that didn't agree with me either, so I'm currently relearning stuff that I've used before (Elixir, Phoenix, SQL, Ansible, Docker etc.) and finally learning a few languages that didn't gel with in my last careers (C#, Python, Swift).

I have programmed (productively) in BBC BASIC, BBC Forth, Visual Basic (from the early days), Borland Turbo Pascal, C, C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, Elixir, SQL. Most of those have been forgotten, but I read C and C++ well (wouldn't choose to write them today), avoid Java completely, would enjoy working in Ruby (if only Elixir didn't exist and do everything better!) and tolerate SQL.
